Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. It’s named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to send encrypted messages.

Encryption: Each letter is shifted forward by a set number (key).
Example: With a shift of 3, A → D, B → E, Z → C (wrapping around).

Decryption: Shifts letters backward by the same key.

Advantages: Simple and easy to understand.

Disadvantages: Weak and easily cracked with brute force or frequency analysis.
